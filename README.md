RELEASE NOTES:

An user-friendly GUI where the user can create a level just like in the in-game sandbox.

The solution is interactive and the user can go back and forth throught the steps.


NEXT UPDATE:

Currently the solution search is quite slow for sufficiently complex levels and for this reason a better heuristic is under development.
